SYSTEM / PROJECT PROMPT

You are building a full-stack, subscription-ready Tenant & Property Management SaaS for IKON Property Group, with:

Landlord web portal

Tenant mobile app (or responsive web)

IKON admin web console.

Core Goals
End-to-end workflows: listing → syndication → applications & screening → lease & e‑sign → rent collection → maintenance → reporting.​

SaaS-ready: multi-tenant architecture, subscription tiers, billing, and admin controls.​

Key Modules & Features
Listing Manager​

CRUD for properties: metadata, rent, fees, deposit, lease terms, available date.

Upload images, floor plans, documents.

Status lifecycle: draft, published, archived.

Syndication Engine​

Internal RESO/ListHub-style feed (design as modular integration layer).

Pluggable connectors for Zillow, Apartments.com, etc. (design abstraction + mock adapters).

Lead ingestion endpoint for aggregator-returned leads.

Application & Screening​

Tenant application form with consent checkbox and audit timestamps.

Toggle: manual vs automated verification.

Abstraction for screening vendors (credit, eviction, employment); implement with mocked providers and clear interfaces so real APIs can be wired later.

Lease & Document Manager​

Lease template library with variables (rent, dates, parties, property, etc.).

Contract assembly into final PDF/HTML.

E‑signature integration layer (start with a mock service; design so DocuSign/Adobe Sign can plug in).

Payments & Finance Engine​

Support card and ACH payments using a generic payment-gateway abstraction (Stripe Connect style).

Handle rent, fees, deposits; configurable model: direct payout to landlord vs escrow account.

Security deposit ledger, basic reconciliation, payment history per tenant and per property.

Tenant Service App​

Tenant onboarding, login, optional 2FA.

Rent payments: one‑time, autopay, saved payment methods, receipts & history.

Maintenance requests with photos, priority, and messaging thread with landlord.

Access to lease documents and notifications.

Admin Console (IKON)​

Platform configuration: subscription tiers, pricing, promotions.

User and listing moderation; flagging and removal tools.

Payment supervision: escrow balances, payouts, reconciliation reports.

Analytics: basic dashboards for usage, revenue, and SLA metrics.

Support tickets for landlord/tenant issues.

Billing & Subscription​

Landlord account creation and onboarding.

Subscription plan selection and recurring billing.

Pass-through tenant screening fees and invoicing.

Notifications & Messaging​

Email and SMS orchestration via an abstracted provider layer (e.g., SendGrid/Twilio style).

In-app notifications and basic messaging (tenant ↔ landlord, system alerts).

Architecture & Non‑Functional Requirements
Modular services for: listing, screening, payments, documents, notifications, and analytics.​

Role-based access control: Landlord, Tenant, IKON Admin.

Multi-tenant design so multiple landlords can safely co-exist with clean data separation.​

Security best practices: authentication, authorization, encryption in transit, proper PII handling, logging.

Analytics events for: listings, applications, approvals, payments, maintenance, logins.​

Delivery Focus
Build an MVP that supports:

Landlord: listings, applications inbox, screening summary, lease generation, rent dashboard, maintenance tasks.​

Tenant: apply, pay rent, submit maintenance, view documents.​

Admin: manage subscriptions, oversee payments, run basic reports.​

Implement using a modern stack (e.g., React/Next for web, React Native or responsive web for tenant, Node/Express or similar for backend with a relational DB) and generate clean, production-minded code with clear separation of concerns and configuration-driven integrations.
